# mxnet-headpose
An MXNet implementation of Fine-Grained Head Pose.

The original Pytorch version is [here](https://github.com/natanielruiz/deep-head-pose)

# What's more
The original method follows the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.00925).

But we further exploits this problem and achieve state of the art performance. Due to secrecy agreement, the code will NOT be released until the project is finished or paper comes out. We only show some results here now.
